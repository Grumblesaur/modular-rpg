  Perks
===============================================================================
Perks are a feature of character leveling. They are minor improvements to an
actor that grant new abilities or bonuses, allowing the actors who take them to
scale with game difficulty. Perks are purchased with Growth Points, the same
"currency" with which skill proficiencies are improved. Perks cannot be bought
more than once unless otherwise specified.
===============================================================================

Ironskin (15 GP)
  (Minimum Resilience of 20)
  Permanently increases the HP of an actor by 5.

Ship Sinker (10 GP)
  (Minimum Knowledge of 20)
  Taking this perk represents an actor's practice in studying people's mouths
  as they speak. They can read lips in one language they are fluent with. This
  perk may be taken multiple times for different languages.

Bedside Manner (5 GP)
  (Cannot be taken if actor has taken Combat as a Second Language.)
  When this actor is speaking to an actor they have treated for injury or
  disease, they receive a +10 bonus to Sense Motive checks against that actor.

Combat as a Second Language (5 GP)
  (Cannot be taken if actor has taken Bedside Manner.)
  When this actor is speaking to an actor they have directly injured, they
  receive a +10 bonus to Sense Motive checks against that actor.

Charger (10 GP)
  (Minimum Vigor of 20)
  If this actor moves in a straight line for at least 10 feet before making an
  attack with a melee weapon, they receive a +10 bonus to hit their target,
  and +1 damage of the same type as the attack if the attack was successful.

The Art of War (12 GP)
  In addition to different styles of dancing, taking this perk allows an actor
  to specialize in dances of weapons. The actor may instantiate Dance for any
  melee weapon not possessing the "Heavy" characteristic, and for such
  instantiations, will use their Agility attribute for combat when they elect
  to Dance instead of Wield. Using Dance in the context of combat is a Primary
  Action.

The Fist and the Furious (12 GP)
  Taking this perk permits an actor to use Dance in place of Brawl in combat
  provided they are not encumbered above their carry weight. Using Dance in
  place of Brawl in the context of combat is a Primary Action, and may be used
  to thwart Grapple checks.
