Perks
===============================================================================

Perks are a feature of character leveling. They are minor improvements to an
actor that grant new abilities or bonuses, allowing the actors who take them to
scale with game difficulty. Perks are purchased with Growth Points, the same
"currency" with which skill proficiencies are improved. Perks cannot be bought
more than once unless otherwise specified.

Ironskin (15 GP)
  (Minimum Resilience of 20)
  Permanently increases the HP of an actor by 5.

Ship Sinker (10 GP)
  (Minimum Knowledge of 20)
  Taking this perk represents an actor's practice in studying people's mouths
  as they speak. They can read lips in one language they are fluent with. This
  perk may be taken multiple times for different languages.

Bedside Manner (5 GP)
  (Cannot be taken if actor has taken Combat as a Second Language.)
  When this actor is speaking to an actor they have treated for injury or
  disease, they receive a +10 bonus to Sense Motive checks against that actor.

Combat as a Second Language (5 GP)
  (Cannot be taken if actor has taken Bedside Manner.)
  When this actor is speaking to an actor they have directly injured, they
  receive a +10 bonus to Sense Motive checks against that actor.

Charger (10 GP)
  (Minimum Vigor of 20)
  If this actor moves in a straight line for at least 10 feet before making an
  attack with a melee weapon, they receive a +10 bonus to hit their target,
  and +1 damage of the same type as the attack if the attack was successful.

Lithe Lethality (6 GP)
  Taking this perk allows an actor to switch their attribute for a Wield Melee
  skill from Vigor to Agility as long as the type of melee weapon used by that
  skill does not have the Heavy weapon characteristic. This perk can be taken
  multiple times, once for each different Wield Melee skill.
 
The Fist and the Furious (12 GP)
  Taking this perk permits an actor to use Dance in place of Brawl in combat
  provided they are not encumbered above their carry weight. Using Dance in
  place of Brawl in the context of combat is a Primary Action, and may be used
  to thwart Grapple checks.

Grappler (15 GP)
  Grapple is a maneuver which allows and actor to wrestle and maintain control
  of another actor. The actor taking Grapple (which is a Primary Action) must
  be standing adjacent to the target. The Grapple action starts a competition
  between the grappler and the target. Each makes a Brawl check. If the
  grappler rolls higher, the grappler has taken hold of the target, and they
  both are standing in the space where the target was standing.
  
  Following a successful Grapple check, the target's attempt to escape the
  grappler (also a Primary Action) is the same skill competition. The grappler
  may use a full-round action to pin the target to the ground, or a primary
  action to make a Brawl check to attack the target. This Brawl check is made
  with a +10 bonus. Also as a primary action, the grappler may make a Brawl
  check to wrest a weapon from the target's hands and knock it to the ground,
  where the target sets the DC with a Grasp roll.

  While grappling, an actor moves at half their speed. The target of a grapple
  cannot move of their own volition until they break the grapple. The grappler
  must have both hands free to initiate a grapple.
