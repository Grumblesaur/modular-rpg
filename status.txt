Character Statistics
--------------------

The well-being, fighting fitness, and general readiness of a character are
measured by several statistics:
  
  Hit Points
  Dodge Class
  Vitality Points
  Vital Threshold
  Exhaustion Points
  Mana Points*


Hit Points and Dodge Class
--------------------------
  
Hit points are a measure of an actor's combat readiness, aggregating physical
and mental health in addition to the actor's will to fight or take risks. An
actor's hit point maximum increases slowly as they develop. Hit point
statistics follow these formulas:
  
  Hit Point Maximum = 35 + floor(resilience / 5)
  
  Hit Point Recovery = 5 + floor(resilience / 10) per short rest.
  
Actors whose Hit Points drop to zero while their Vitality Points number at
least one become Incapacitated, described under Conditions.

An actor's dodge class is a measure of how difficult they are to strike in
combat, either from nimbleness or armor. It is calculated:
  
  Dodge Class = 50 + armor bonus + floor(agility / 10) + situational bonus

When an attack roll (made with a Wield or Brawl check, ordinarily) exceeds an
actor's dodge class, that actor is struck by the attack, and the attacker will
roll to determine the damage.


Vitality and Exhaustion
-----------------------

Vitality Points are a measure of an actor's ability to withstand physical
shock. Severe attacks cause injuries that require greater recovery times and
more rest. Most actors have only 3 VP, although these values can be changed in
some rare circumstances, as through quirks, perks, or story events. Vitality
point statisics follow these formulas:
  
  Max Vitality Points = 3
  
  Vitality Point Recovery = All on long rest when not Exhausted
  
An actor's Vital Threshold is the amount of damage which will incur vital
damage, that is, damage at which the actor's VP is diminished. An actor's
vital threshold is:
  
  Vital Threshold = 10 + floor(resilience / 20)

When an actor takes damage, the method by which VP damage is calculated is:

  Vitality Damage = floor(damage taken / vital threshold)

In other words, vitality damage is taken whenever an attack's damage output is
at least equal to the actor's vital threshold, with an extra point for every
multiple above that it reaches.

When an actor's Vitality Points drop to zero, they fall Unconscious, described
under Conditions below. If an actor's Vitality Points fall below zero, they
are dead.

If an actor is not killed while they are unconscious, and they are taken to
where they can safely recover, they will awaken after a short rest, with 1 VP
restored, and 1 Exhaustion Point, as well as the HP they recover from a short
rest.

When an actor has Exhaustion Points, they are unable to recover Vitality from
a long rest. One Exhaustion Point is removed from an actor for every long rest
until they reach zero, at which point long rests will begin to restore
Vitality Points for them again. Exhausted actors suffer the following effects:

  Exhaustion Penalty =
    Penalty to all skill checks of -5 * EP,
    Hit Point recovery penalty of  -1 * EP

Actors with more than 3 VP will suffer an additional -5 penalty to all skill
checks and an additional -1 HP recovery for each additional EP they accrue.

Should an actor's EP ever exceed their max VP, they will die at some point
during the course of the eight hours to follow, barring a miracle of game
master intervention of course. This slow death can be used as an opportunity
by the actor to voice their last words.


Mana Points*
-----------

Mana Points are a measure of the size and might of an actor's soul. Actors who
use magic and cast spells will utilize energy from this pool. The pool is of
the size:
  
  Mana Point Maximum = 35 + floor(soul / 5)


Conditions
----------

In Modular RPG, actors can have a variety of status conditions, which change
some of their character statistics.
  
  Normal
  Incapacitated
  Disabled
  Unconscious
  Asleep

Actors with Normal status are suffering from no other conditions, and function
as their statistics describe without modification.

An actor becomes Incapacitated when their HP drops to 0 but their VP remains
above 0. In this state, an actor is lying on the ground, either prone or
supine, with their speed dropped to 0 and their VT reduced by half. They
cannot take Reactions, Full-round actions, or movement (except for 5 feet of
movement offered by a Secondary action) and may not use a full round action.
If another actor makes a successful Treat Injury check on an Incapacitated
actor, that actor regains 1 HP and becomes Disabled instead. An actor who is
Incapacitated will return to Normal status after a short rest.

When an actor is Disabled, their speed and VT are halved. They cannot take
Reactions or Full-round actions. An actor who is Disabled will return to
Normal status after a short rest.

When an actor is Unconscious, their VT drops to 1 and they are unable to move,
take actions, make skill checks, or respond to stimuli. An actor becomes
Unconscious by having their VP drop to 0. After a short rest, an Unconscious
actor will return to Normal status and gain 1 VP and 1 EP, in addition to the
HP recovery from a short rest.

When an actor is Asleep, their VT drops to 1 and they are unable to move,
take actions, or make skill checks, but they can still respond to stimuli. A
sleeping actor will awaken if they are attacked and not killed, if they are
touched or shaken repeatedly, or if they are subjected to bright lights or
loud sounds.


Body Positions
--------------

Some minor effects are applied to an actor depending on their position.
  
  Standing
  Crouching
  Prone
  Supine

A standing actor has no advantages or ill effects.

A crouching actor has a +10 bonus to their dodge class against Aimed attacks,
but a -10 to their dodge class against Melee attacks. An actor can drop into a
crouching stance for free, but must expend 10 feet of movement to rise to a
standing position.

A prone actor has a +15 bonus to their dodge class against Aimed attacks, but
a -15 to their dodge class against Melee attacks. All terrain is considered
difficult terrain while prone. They have -10 on any checks made as attacks,
but a +10 on Trip checks. An actor can drop prone for free, but must expend
15 feet of movement to rise to a standing position.

A supine actor has a +15 bonus to their dodge class against Aimed attacks, but
a -15 to their dodge class against Melee attacks. An actor must make a DC 50
Tumble check to fall supine. On a pass, they fall gracefully. On a failure,
they take 1d4 bludgeoning damage. A supine actor cannot move, and they must
expend all their speed to return to a standing position, or 15 feet of
movement to flip to a prone position.
