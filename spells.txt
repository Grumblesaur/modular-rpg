  When first taking this spell, you select one element, and that will be the
  damage type for this spell. This spell may be taken multiple times for
  different elements. Make a [Spellcasting Skill] check against the target's
  dodge class. If you succeed, you deal 1d10 + ([Attribute] // 10) of
  <Element> damage, with the secondary effect listed with each element applied
  as well.
  
Dowse (10 GP)
  Casting time: 1 minute
  Duration: 10 minutes
  
  Use magic forces to guide you to a source of water, a type of vegetation,
  a suspected hidden item, or a type of ore. The game master sets a difficulty
  class, against which you roll a [Spellcasting Skill] check. If the check
  succeeds, then a mystical force will gently pull you toward the object of
  your desires for the duration, out to 60 tiles from where you initially cast
  this spell.

Find North (8 GP)
  Casting time: 1 primary action
  Duration:     1 hour
  
  When using this spell, an illusory image of an arrow appears on the back of
  one of the caster's hands. The arrow always points toward True North, thus
  the image will rotate, as if a tattoo come to life. A slight burning
  sensation is felt when facing due South.
