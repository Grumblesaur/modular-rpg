Basic Spells and Modifications
------------------------------

A spell is a perk that an actor can take, provided they have a prerequisite 
perk that allocates them the ability to cast spells. A spell's description
consists of its name, growth point cost to purchase, casting time, duration of
effect, and a brief text explaining conditions, damage, or rules.

Spell modifications may also be purchased. Modifications are a collection of
generic, general-purpose improvements which can be applied to spells. Not all
modifications can be applied to every spell.

Modifications must be purchased individually for each spell, as they are a
measure of an actor's practice and ability to improvise with that particular
spell. When casting, spell modifications will add their own magic cost to the
cost of a spell. When spell modifications are applied, the cheapest-costing
spell modification's magic point cost is ignored. As such, casting a spell
with a single modification has no additional cost.


Spell Examples
--------------

Elements:
  Fire    Sonic
  Frost   Corrosion
  Shock

Burst <Element> (12 GP)
  <Fire>      -> Firebolt    (Flames are briefly visible around the target.)
  <Frost>     -> Icicle      (Chips of ice surround the target for two tiles.)
  <Shock>     -> Spark       (Hair on the target and others for two tiles out
                              stands on end.)
  <Sonic>     -> Thunderclap (Thunder is heard for 40 tiles from the target.)
  <Corrosion> -> Acid Stream (Vegetation withers for two tiles out.)
  
  Casting time: 1 primary action
  Duration:     Instantaneous
  
  When first taking this spell, you select one element, and that will be the
  damage type for this spell. This spell may be taken multiple times for
  different elements. Make a [Spellcasting Skill] check against the target's
  dodge class. If you succeed, you deal 1d10 + ([Attribute] // 10) of
  <Element> damage, with the secondary effect listed with each element applied
  as well.
  
Dowse (10 GP)
  Casting time: 1 minute
  Duration: 10 minutes
  
  Use magic forces to guide you to a source of water, a type of vegetation,
  a suspected hidden item, or a type of ore. The game master sets a difficulty
  class, against which you roll a [Spellcasting Skill] check. If the check
  succeeds, then a mystical force will gently pull you toward the object of
  your desires for the duration, out to 60 tiles from where you initially cast
  this spell.

Find North (8 GP)
  Casting time: 1 primary action
  Duration:     1 hour
  
  When using this spell, an illusory image of an arrow appears on the back of
  one of the caster's hands. The arrow always points toward True North, thus
  the image will rotate, as if a tattoo come to life. A slight burning
  sensation is felt when facing due South.
