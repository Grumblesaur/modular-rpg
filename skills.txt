------------------ Skill Proficiencies ------------------
The following skill checks are equivalent to checks with
the toolkit appropriate to performing the skill. Worded
differently, skill proficiencies are tool proficiencies
and vice-versa.

Possessing the correct tools for a task
will provide a large bonus, using improvised tools for a
task will provide a small bonus, and using no tools
will incur a small penalty.

Appraise, Cook, Craft, Dance, Play, Repair, Treat, and Wield are
skills that apply to different kinds of objects. Actors may
have multiple copies of these skills, "instantiated" for
the particular class of item. One actor may be skilled in
Appraise <Jewelry>, but another might be skilled in
Appraise <Real Estate>. The categories are left to the
player's imagination and the game master's discretion.

Too general a category will grant too much leeway, but
too specific and the actor will seldom find it useful.
Craft <Musical Instrument> may be too broad, while
Craft <Violin> might be too narrow. A middle ground, such
as Craft <Bowed Instrument>, might be more suitable for
one actor.

Play and Wield are intended to be somewhat more specific.
It would not be unreasonable for an actor to simply have
Play <Guitar> or Wield <Longsword>.

The game master should offer advice as to what level of
detail they will be running the game at, and whether
specificity or generality is preferred for the roleplaying
environment.

It is the player's decision as to whether they specialize
in a small set of skills which they grow quickly, or to
spread out among several different disciplines. For skills
which require tools, instruments, or weapons, the player
must possess the appropriate equipment when they level up
to advance these skills. Roleplaying practice is recommended,
but whether it is required is left to game master discretion.

Skills whose attribute is marked with a * are from a non-core module, but are
being used in current playtesting and development.

Skills have usage limitations. Non-combat skills cannot be used under the
stress of fighting, but can be used in other contexts. Combat skills can only
be used in combat as the type of action they are specified for (i.e. Primary,
Secondary, or Tertiary), but can be used out of combat in any context which is
appropriate.

Some skills involve tools. The game master can decide whether a task is
impossible or merely impeded due to a lack of tools. When an actor engages in
a task that is merely impeded without tools, a modifier is applied to their
skill check according to what supplies they have:

  No tools:                    -10
  Partial or improvised tools:  0
  Appropriate tools:           +10

Where the game master deems appropriate, skill checks may situationally call
for a different attribute. Any skill check may be rolled with Knowledge in
place of its usual Attribute for history or technical information about that
skill, as an example. The use of skills as a knowledge check never requires
tools

  a running start of at least 10 feet in a straight line, an actor can perform
  a long jump on a successful Jump check. A long jump's maximum distance is:
    
    Long jump = 5 + floor(Vigor / 5) feet
  
  An actor can perform a high jump with a running start of at least 5 feet and
  a successful Jump check. A high jump's maximum height is:

  Lift is a measure of an actor's ability to suspend heavy objects with their
  body. The amount an actor can lift freely is their Carry Weight, but for
  carrying weight between their carry weight and their overload, an actor must
  succeed on a Lift check.

  across their carry weights. Actors whose fair share of the load falls into
  their overload range must make a Lift check.

  specified type.

Repair <Type of Object>
  Attribute: Knowledge
  Usage: Non-combat
  Tools: Trade-specific
  
  Repair is a measure of an actor's ability to mend, recalibrate, or adjust
  objects of the specified type.

Run
  Attribute: Resilience
  Usage: Primary
  
  Run is a measure of an actor's ability to maintain a fast, steady pace on
  foot for an extended period of time. When using the Dash action in combat to
  rush past an adversary, the adversary may initiate an attack of opportunity.
  If they do so, the actor who is dashing must make make a Run roll of a total
  greater than their adversary's attack roll to avoid being hit.
  
  Outside of combat, Run is used to sustain speed during when the actor is
  racing or attempting to escape something. The game master sets the DC and
  the effects on the actor's movement for a success or a failure.

Search
  Attribute: Intuition
  Usage: Primary
  
  Search is a measure of an actor's ability to find lost or hidden objects,

  particularly in a way that other actors will find entertaining or artistic.

Shift
  Attribute: Vigor

  Shift is a measure of an actor's ability to push, pull, or drag objects
  along the ground. An actor can freely push, pull, and drag objects up to
  their overload in weight at their overloaded speed. For objects greater than
  their overload in weight, the difficulty class for Shift is:
  
    Shift DC = 50 + floor(10 * (Weight / Overload))
  
  After a successful shift check, the actor can move the object at their
  overloaded speed for up to one minute at a time.
  
  Actors who team up to move large objects will evenly divide the load across
  their overloads. For actors whose fair share of the load is greater than
  their overload, they will need to make a Shift check.
  
Sneak
  Attribute: Agility
  Usage: Primary
  
  Sneak is a measure of an actor's ability to go unnoticed in movement, by
  either moving quickly and staying out of sight, or by moving silently, as
  the situation requires.

Swim
  Attribute: Resilience
  Usage: Primary
  
  Swim is a measure of an actor's ability to stay afloat and move in water or
  other liquids. A failed Swim check in slow-moving or still water does not
  immediately result in drowning, but rather prevents the actor from moving
  their speed in water (i.e. they are treading water). A successful swim check
  must be made before an actor can use their speed in water.
  
  Failed Swim checks in stronger currents, or after multiple failures, may
  result in the actor floundering or drowning.
  
  Water does not count as difficult terrain if the actor is swimming. Wading
  in water causes the water to act like difficult terrain.
  

Tamper
  Attribute: Finesse
  Usage: Primary
  Tools: Optional, bonuses granted by game master
  
  Tamper is a measure of an actor's ability to disarm, dislodge, unlock, or
