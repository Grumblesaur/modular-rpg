Skills and Their Applications
==============================================================================
The following skill checks are equivalent to checks with the toolkit
appropriate to performing the skill. Worded differently, skill proficiencies
are tool proficiencies and vice-versa.

Possessing the correct tools for a task will provide a large bonus, using
improvised tools for a task will provide a small bonus, and using no tools
will incur a small penalty.

Craft, Know, Play, and Wield are skills that apply to different kinds of
objects. Actors may have multiple copies of these skills, "instantiated" for
the particular class of item. One actor may be skilled in Craft<Jewelry>, but
another might be skilled in Craft<Timepiece>. The categories are left to the
player's imagination and the game master's discretion.

Too general a category will grant too much leeway, but too specific and the
actor will seldom find it useful. Craft <Musical Instrument> may be too broad,
while Craft <Violin> might be too narrow. A middle ground, such as Craft
<Bowed Instrument>, might be more suitable for one actor.

The game master should offer advice as to what level of detail they will be
running the game at, and whether specificity or generality is preferred for
the roleplaying environment.

It is the player's decision as to whether they specialize in a small set of
skills which they grow quickly, or to spread out among several different
disciplines. For skills which require tools, instruments, or weapons, the
player must possess the appropriate equipment when they level up to advance
these skills. Roleplaying acts of practice is recommended, but whether it is
required is left to game master discretion.

Skills whose attribute is marked with a * are from a non-core module, but are
being used in current playtesting and development.

Skills have usage limitations. Non-combat skills cannot be used under the
stress of fighting, but can be used in other contexts. Combat skills can only
be used in combat as the type of action they are specified for (i.e. Primary,
Secondary, or Tertiary), but can be used out of combat in any context which is
appropriate.

Some skills involve tools. The game master can decide whether a task is
impossible or merely impeded due to a lack of tools. When an actor engages in
a task that is merely impeded without tools, a modifier is applied to their
skill check according to what supplies they have:

  No tools:                    -10
  Partial or improvised tools:  0
  Appropriate tools:           +10

Where the game master deems appropriate, skill checks may situationally call
for a different attribute. Any skill check may be rolled with Knowledge in
place of its usual Attribute for history or technical information about that
skill, as an example. The use of skills as a knowledge check never requires
tools


Attune
  Attribute: Soul*
  Usage: Secondary
  
  Attune is a measure of an actor's ability to interface with magical items
  and constructs, and attempting to use such items will require an Attune

Blend
  Attribute: Presence
  Usage: Non-combat
  
  Blend is a measure of an actor's ability to act like other actors in their
  environment, and to go unnoticed despite being an outsider. Blending hides
  the actor in plain sight, without disguise or stealth, causing them to go
  unnoticed purely because nothing about them seems worth noticing.
  
  When a character is in a situation where they need to suppress an emotional
  reaction, they will need to make a Blend check.

  Usage: Primary
  
  Brawl is a measure of an actor's ability to fight with only their body --
  arms, legs, hands, feet, head, etc.

Cast <Type of Magic>
  Attribute: Soul*
  Usage: Determinant on spell specification.
  Tools: Determinant on spell specification.
  
  Cast is a measure of an actor's ability to cast spells. A spell's function

         handholds.
  
  Climb is a measure of an actor's ability to scale and rappel steep surfaces
  and objects. In instances of scaling a wall or cliff with few handholds,
  tools are necessary. When climbing in combat, surfaces that require a Climb
  check are considered difficult terrain for movement expense, and require a
  successful climb check in order to be traversed.

Craft <Type of Item>

  Craft is a measure of an actor's ability to assemble, cook, or design items

  Flourish is a measure of an actor's equilibrium and ability to stand on or
  traverse narrow surfaces without falling or faltering, catching oneself or
  falling gracefully, and catching or deflecting incoming objects.
  
  When an actor falls, they take damage in relation to the height of their
  fall. The formula for fall damage is:
    
    Dice to roll = floor(Height of fall in feet / 10)
    
    Damage = (Dice to roll)d8
    
  In other words, for every 10 feet an actor falls, they suffer 1d8 damage.
  For falls shorter than 10 feet, actors take no damage. 
  
  Flourish is also the skill that defends an actor from a Trip check made
  against them.
  
  The act of catching or swatting away an object may be used in
  combat as a reaction, provided the target of the act is not ammunition for
  a weapon.

Forage

  Forage is a measure of an actor's ability to find useful natural resources
  in the wilderness.

  and give commands to animals.

Heft
  Attribute: Vigor
  Usage: Primary
  
  Heft is a measure of an actor's ability to move large, heavy objects under
  their own strength. The amount an actor can lift freely is their carry
  weight, but an actor must succeed on a Heft check to exceed that amount:
    
    DC = Weight of object in pounds - floor(Carry weight / 2)
  
  Actors who team up to lift objects together will evenly divide the weight
  across their carry weights. Actors whose fair share of the load exceeds
  their carry weight must make a skill check for lifting their portion of the
  load.
  
  Actors cannot lift or carry more than their overload weight, except for very
  short distances or periods of time.
  
  Pushing, pulling, and dragging objects follow similar rules. An actor can
  push, pull, or drag up to their overload in weight at their overloaded
  speed. For loads greater than that, use the following formula for the DC of
  the Heft check:
    
    DC = floor((Weight / 3) + (Weight / Overload) * 10)
  
  Actors who team up to push, pull, or drag an object will evenly divide the
  load between them. Actors whose fair share of the load exceeds their
  overload must make a Heft check for the weight of their fair share.
 
Hide
  Attribute: Agility
  Usage: Primary
  
  Hide is a measure of an actor's ability to make themselves unseen when
  remaining still, often by contorting their body to squeeze into small
  spaces. Attempting to move while hiding will initiate a Sneak check.

Inspire
  Attribute: Presence
  Usage: Secondary
  
  Inspire is a measure of an actor's ability to impress, awe, or motivate
  another actor by virtue of their own mannerisms of speech and confidence in
  their own actions. To inspire an actor is to help them overcome their fears

  actor's fears and insecurities, or to project a sense of ferocity about
  themselves, to influence their mood or point of view.

Investigate
  Attribute: Allure
  Usage: Non-combat
  
  Investigate is a measure of an actor's ability to discover information from
  other actors and their environment about a particular person, location, or

  Jump is a measure of an actor's ability to leap gaps or spring upwards. With
  a running start of at least 10 feet in a straight line, an actor can perform
  a long jump on a successful Jump check. A long jump's maximum distance is:
    
    Long jump = 5 + floor(Vigor / 5) feet
  
  An actor can perform a high jump with a running start of at least 5 feet and
  a successful Jump check. A high jump's maximum height is:
  
    High jump = floor(Vigor / 10) feet or 1 foot, whichever's higher.

  for example, singing is treated as Play <Voice>.

Recall
  Attribute: Knowledge
  Usage: Secondary
  
  Recall is a measure of an actor's ability to recall important details and
  facts when the player controlling the actor might have forgotten. It's a

  Run is a measure of an actor's ability to maintain a fast, steady pace on
  foot for an extended period of time. When using the Dash action in combat to
  rush past an adversary, the adversary may initiate an attack of opportunity.
  If they do so, the actor who is dashing must make make a Run roll of a total
  greater than their adversary's attack roll to avoid being hit.
  
  Outside of combat, Run is used to sustain speed during when the actor is
  racing or attempting to escape something. The game master sets the DC and
  the effects on the actor's movement for a success or a failure.

Scribe
  Attribute: Finesse
  Usage: Non-combat
  Tools: A writing utensil and a surface to draw on.
  
  Draw is a measure of an actor's ability to accurately depict creatures,

  typically non-natural ones like switches, items, and weapons, in their
  environment.

Sense Motive
  Attribute: Intuition
  Usage: Secondary
  
  Sense Motive is a measure of an actor's ability to estimate the intentions
  of another actor, in speech, writing, or the layout of their environment.
  This skill will often be used as a dynamic means of creating a DC for
  Charm, Deceive, Intimidate, or Persuade checks.

Sneak
  Attribute: Agility
  Usage: Primary
  
  Sneak is a measure of an actor's ability to go unnoticed in movement, by
  either moving quickly and staying out of sight, or by moving silently, as
  the situation requires.

Swim
  Attribute: Resilience
  Usage: Primary
  
  Swim is a measure of an actor's ability to stay afloat and move in water or
  other liquids. A failed Swim check in slow-moving or still water does not
  immediately result in drowning, but rather prevents the actor from moving
  their speed in water (i.e. they are treading water). A successful swim check
  must be made before an actor can use their speed in water.
  
  Failed Swim checks in stronger currents, or after multiple failures, may
  result in the actor floundering or drowning.
  
  Water does not count as difficult terrain if the actor is swimming. Wading
  in water causes the water to act like difficult terrain.

  Usage: Full-round
  Tools: Determinant on the object being manipulated.
  
  Tamper is a measure of an actor's ability to repair, recalibrate, disarm,

  Attribute: Intuition
  Usage: Non-combat
  
  Track is a measure of an actor's ability to follow a creature of the
  specified type from its foot prints, scents, telltale effects on features of
  the flora and fauna of the environment, and an understanding of its natural
  behaviors and instincts.

Treat Disease
  Attribute: Knowledge
  Usage: Non-combat
  Tools: Determinant on the type of disease, but likely to involve remedies,
         special procedures, physical assistance, food, water, or rest.
  
  Treat Disease is a measure of an actor's ability to provide care or cure to
  other actors (or themselves) as they suffer from an illness.

Treat Injury
  Attribute: Knowledge
  Usage: Full-round
  Tools: Determinant on the type of injury, but likely to involve salves,
         bandages, bindings, food, water, or rest.
  
  Treat Injury is a measure of an actor's ability to provide care and medicine
  to other actors as they suffer from a wound. When used as an action in
  combat, a Treat Injury check may be used to apply a bandage or tourniquet to
  a wounded actor to prevent a grave injury from growing worse later.

Trip
  Attribute: Agility
  Usage: Primary
  
  Trip is a measure of an actor's ability to take other actors by surprise and
  throw them off balance. The target of a Trip check sets the DC with a
  Flourish check. If the actor making the Trip check beats the DC, the target
  falls to the ground. The game master determines whether the player falls
  supine or prone, as would be appropriate for the scenario. If the Trip check
  fails, the target remains standing.

Wield <Type of Weapon>
  Attribute: Determinant on Weapon Type.
  Usage: Primary, Reaction
  Tools: A weapon of the specified type.
  
  Wield is a measure of an actor's ability to fight effectively with a weapon
  of the specified type.
  
  In certain circumstances, Wield can be taken as a reaction with a melee
  weapon. When an adversary dashes through an actor's space, they make a Wield
  check against a Run check by the adversary. The attack succeeds if it beats
  the DC set by the Run check.
