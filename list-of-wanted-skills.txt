------------------ Skill Proficiencies ------------------
The following skill checks are equivalent to checks with
the toolkit appropriate to performing the skill. Worded
differently, skill proficiencies are tool proficiencies
and vice-versa.

Possessing the correct tools for a task
will provide a large bonus, using improvised tools for a
task will provide a small bonus, and using no tools
will incur a small penalty.

Appraise, Cook, Craft, Play, Repair, and Wield are skills
that apply to different kinds of objects. Actors may have
multiple copies of these skills, "instantiated" for the
particular class of item. One actor may be skilled in
Appraise <Jewelry>, but another might be skilled in
Appraise <Real Estate>. The categories are left to the
player's imagination and the game master's discretion.

Too general a category will grant too much leeway, but
too specific and the actor will seldom find it useful.
Craft <Musical Instrument> may be too broad, while
Craft <Violin> might be too narrow. A middle ground, such
as Craft <Bowed Instrument>, might be more suitable for
one actor.

Play and Wield are intended to be somewhat more specific.
It would not be unreasonable for an actor to simply have
Play <Guitar> or Wield <Longsword>.

The game master should offer advice as to what level of
detail they will be running the game at, and whether
specificity or generality is preferred for the roleplaying
environment.

It is the player's decision as to whether they specialize
in a small set of skills which they grow quickly, or to
spread out among several different disciplines. For skills
which require tools, instruments, or weapons, the player
must possess the appropriate equipment when they level up
to advance these skills. Roleplaying practice is recommended,
but whether it is required is left to game master discretion.
