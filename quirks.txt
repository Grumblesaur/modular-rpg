Quirks
===============================================================================

Quirks are a feature of character creation. They are minor changes to an actor
to allow for different gameplay styles and more focused, specialized builds.
Quirks can also be used to differentiate different races.

Sense of Direction:
  Replace Knowledge with Intuition for Navigate checks, but receive no bonus
  for using orienteering tools when doing so, and receive no penalties for
  doing so without any tools at all.

Silent But Deadly:
  Replace Presence with Vigor as the attribute for Intimidate.

Gone Ballistic:
  Replace Finesse with Vigor as the attribute for Wield when making a thrown
  weapon attack.

Tread Lightly:
  Replace Agility with Finesse as the attribute for Sneak.

Antlers (Sarav):
  (Fyrdwelli only.) This actor has pointed protrusions extending from their
  head. They cannot wear any headgear which does not accomodate for these
  protrusions. This actor may also make an attack with their horns using a
  Brawl check. If they moved in a straight line toward the target for at least
  10 feet before attacking, this attack deals 1d8 piercing damage. Otherwise,
  it deals 1d6.

Spirit of the Phoenix:
  This actor has their Vital Threshold lowered by two permanently, but once
  during their life they will recover from having their Vitality Points
  reduced to -1 or from having their exhaustion raised beyond their maximum
  VP.
  
  They will become conscious eight hours after the blow that should have killed
  them, although they will remain incapacitated until their exhaustion is no
  longer greater than their max VP. They will also have suffered a permanent
  injury, regardless of whether the attack that invoked this quirk was a
  critical hit. The rest of the recovery process plays as usual.
 
Artist of Seduction:
  Replace Agility with Allure as the attribute for Dance.

Apothecary:
  (Requires Corpus module) Replace Knowledge with Corpus as the
  attribute for a Treat Disease skill.

  all ties in skill competitions others initiate with them.

  all ties in skill competitions others initiate with them.
