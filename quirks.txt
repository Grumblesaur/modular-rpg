  Quirks
===============================================================================
Quirks are a feature of character creation. They are minor changes to an actor
to allow for different gameplay styles and more focused, specialized builds.
Quirks can also be used to differentiate different races.

Sense of Direction:
  Replace Knowledge with Intuition for Navigate checks, but receive no bonus
  for using orienteering tools when doing so, and receive no penalties for
  doing so without any tools at all.

Silent But Deadly:
  Replace Presence with Vigor as the attribute for Intimidate.

Gone Ballistic:
  Can use Vigor instead of Finesse as the attribute for wielding a Thrown
  weapon.

Tread Lightly:
  Replace Agility with Finesse as the attribute for Sneak.

Horns/Antlers (Sarav):
  (Fyrdwelli only.) This actor has pointed protrusions extending from their
  head. They cannot wear any headgear which does not accomodate for these
  protrusions. This actor may also make an attack with their horns using a
  Brawl check. If they moved in a straight line toward the target for at least
  15 feet before attacking, this attack deals 1d8 piercing damage. Otherwise,
  it deals 1d6.
