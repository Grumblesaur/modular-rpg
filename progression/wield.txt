Perks for Wield
==============================================================================

Shock and Awe (20 Ranks)
  For the chosen type of weapon of this wield skill, an actor's fearsome blows
  or precise aim in combat evoke fear in their adversary's mind. When an
  attack with this Wield skill is made and misses within a margin of 5 of the
  target's DC, this attack deals 1 damage anyway.

Lithe Lethality (20 Ranks) (Melee Only)
  For the chosen type of weapon of this wield skill, an actor may substitute
  their Finesse score in place of their Vigor score for Wield checks made with
  this skill, provided the weapon in use does not have the Heavy property.

Marksman (20 Ranks) (Aimed Only)
  For the chosen type of weapon of this wield skill, an actor may substitute
  their Agility score in place of their Vigor score (replace a strong, held
  draw with a fast one), or their Resilience score in place of their Finesse
  score (for a shot aimed and braced by the body to maintain steady, rather
  than by the arms), as is appropriate to the attribute required by the
  weapon.

Arms Akimbo (30 Ranks) (Melee Only)
  For the chosen type of weapon of this wield skill, an actor is able to wield
  two weapons, one in each hand. The actor may use a Secondary Action to make a
  Wield check with the weapon in their non-dominant hand. This additional
  attack is made with a -10 penalty to the Wield check.
  
  The weapon in the actor's non-dominant hand must have the Light property.

Focus Fire (30 Ranks) (Aimed Only)
  For the chosen type of weapon of this wield skill, an actor is able to make
  a second wield check with this weapon as a Secondary Action. This additional
  attack is made with a -10 penalty to the wield check.
  
  The weapon that the actor is using must be a two-handed weapon, such as a
  bow or crossbow.
