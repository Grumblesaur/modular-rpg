Perks
===============================================================================

Perks are a feature of character leveling. They are minor improvements to an
actor that grant new abilities or bonuses, allowing the actors who take them to
scale with game difficulty. Perks are purchased with Growth Points, the same
"currency" with which skill proficiencies are improved. Perks cannot be bought
more than once unless otherwise specified.

Ironskin (15 GP)
  (Minimum Resilience of 20)
  Permanently increases the HP of an actor by 5.

Ship Sinker (10 GP)
  (Minimum Knowledge of 20)
  Taking this perk represents an actor's practice in studying people's mouths
  as they speak. They can read lips in one language they are fluent with. This
  perk may be taken multiple times for different languages.

The Fist and the Furious (12 GP)
  Taking this perk permits an actor to use Dance in place of Brawl in combat
  provided they are not encumbered above their carry weight. Using Dance in
  place of Brawl in the context of combat is a Primary Action, and may be used
  to thwart Grapple checks.

Grappler (15 GP) ---->> integrate this into Brawl
  Grapple is a maneuver which allows and actor to wrestle and maintain control
  of another actor. The actor taking Grapple (which is a Primary Action) must
  be standing adjacent to the target. The Grapple action starts a competition
  between the grappler and the target. Each makes a Brawl check. If the
  grappler rolls higher, the grappler has taken hold of the target, and they
  both are standing in the space where the target was standing.
  
  Following a successful Grapple check, the target's attempt to escape the
  grappler (also a Primary Action) is the same skill competition. The grappler
  may use a full-round action to pin the target to the ground, or a primary
  action to make a Brawl check to attack the target. This Brawl check is made
  with a +10 bonus. Also as a primary action, the grappler may make a Brawl
  check to wrest a weapon from the target's hands and knock it to the ground,
  where the target sets the DC with a Grasp roll.

  While grappling, an actor moves at half their speed. The target of a grapple
  cannot move of their own volition until they break the grapple. The grappler
  must have both hands free to initiate a grapple. 

Theodore Roosevelt (6 GP)
  When wielding a heavy bludgeon or staff, +10 to checks involving the actor's
  Presence attribute.


Trip ---->> integrate this into Brawl
  Attribute: Agility
  Usage: Primary
  
  Trip is a measure of an actor's ability to take other actors by surprise and
  throw them off balance. The target of a Trip check sets the DC with a
  Flourish check. If the actor making the Trip check beats the DC, the target
  falls to the ground. The game master determines whether the player falls
  supine or prone, as would be appropriate for the scenario. If the Trip check
  fails, the target remains standing.
