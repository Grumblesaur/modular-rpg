  of their choice with a +10 bonus. The player may choose to apply this bonus
  before or after rolling, but it must be before the game master decides the
  outcome of the check. If the inspired check is an attack, it will deal +1
  extra damage when successful.
  
  When a target is demoralized, they make their next check with a -10 penalty.
  If the target's next check is an attack, damage will be reduced by 1.
  
  An actor cannot be demoralized or inspired by multiple actors at once.
  Attempting to demoralize an already-inspired actor will have no effect, and

  An inspired actor must use their bonus within one day, or the bonus is
  forfeit.
