Carrying Capacity and Movement of Heavy Objects
==============================================================================

An actor's carry weight is the maximum amount of weight in pounds that
they can carry without adverse effects. It is calculated as:
  
  Carry Weight = 50 + (5 * floor(Vigor / 10)) + (5 * floor(Resilience / 10)) lb
  
An actor can carry up to their carry weight in their hands, in bags, pouches,
holsters, loops, and pockets fastened to their body or clothes, or some
combination thereof without any adverse effects.

In some circumstances, an actor's carry weight is insufficient for what they
need to carry. For these circumstances, they can carry up to their Overload:
  
  Overload = Carry Weight + floor(Carry Weight / 2) lb
  
While the amount an actor is carrying is between their carry weight and their
overload, their speed and dodge class are lowered:

  Overloaded Speed = Speed - 15
  
  Overloaded Dodge Class = Dodge Class - 25

Overloaded actors will also lose 2 HP per hour from carrying excess weight.
